Most issues short of serious physical damage can be repaired at\nhome. Read the instructions carefully for your own safety, as some repairs may expose\nyou to risk of serious electric shock.\n1\n2\n3Diagnosing the Problem\nCheck your warranty. Most new computers come with at least a year of\nwarranty. If your warranty is still active, contact the manufacturer to have it\nrepaired for free or for a reduced price. Attempting the repair yourself will likely\nvoid the warranty.\nCheck the power indicator lights. If your monitor won\'t display an image,\nturn it on and watch the lights at the edge of the monitor. If one or more\nlights turn on, continue to the next step. If the lights won\'t light up, the power\nsupply is broken (or one of the attachments leading to the power supply). This\nis usually caused by a blown capacitor. You may repair it yourself, but be aware\nthat the power supply includes dangerous, high voltage components. Unless\nyou have significant electronics repair experience, take your monitor to a\nprofessional repair service.\nOther signs of a blown capacitor include a loud humming noise, lines\nacross the screen, and multiple images.\nThe power supply unit is one of the most expensive components in the\nmonitor. If the problem is more serious than a blown capacitor, the price of\nrepair could be considerable. A replacement may be a better idea if your\nmonitor is getting old.\nAdvertisement\nShine a flashlight on the monitor. Try this if your monitor just displays a\nblack screen, but the power indicator light does come on. If you can seeMethod\n16/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 1/94\n5\n6\n7the image when you point a light at the screen, the monitor\'s backlight is at\nfault. Follow these instructions to replace it.\nRepair stuck pixels. If most of the screen works but a few pixels are\n"stuck" at one color, the fix is usually easy. Keep the monitor on and try the\nfollowing:\nWrap a pencil tip (or other blunt, narrow object) in a damp, non-abrasive\ncloth. Rub very gently over the stuck pixel. Rubbing too hard can cause\nfurther damage.\nSearch for stuck pixel repair software online. These conduct rapid color\nchanges to jolt the pixel into working again.\nPurchase hardware designed to plug into your monitor and repair dead\npixels.\nIf none of the above works, you may need to replace your screen.\nAttempt to fix spiderweb cracks or black splotches. These are signs of\nphysical damage. A monitor at this stage is often beyond repair, and\nattempts to fix it can end up causing more harm. However, if the screen is not\nusable in its current state, there\'s no harm in trying a repair before you look for\na replacement:\nRun a soft cloth or other object over the screen. If you feel any broken\nglass, do not attempt repair. Replace the monitor instead.\nRub the scratch with a clean eraser, as gently as you can. Wipe off the\neraser whenever residue builds up.\nPurchase an LCD scratch repair kit.\nRead this article for more homemade solutions.\nReplace the display. If you\'re using a standalone LCD monitor, consider\npurchasing a replacement. This may be more cost-effective than having\nnew components installed in an old monitor with a shorter lifespan. However, if\nyou have a laptop or a relatively new device, purchase a replacement LCD\ndisplay panel. Hire a professional to install it.\nThe panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device,\nusually on the back. Use this to order a new panel from the manufacturer.\nWhile you can attempt to replace the panel yourself, the process is difficult\nand can expose you to dangerously high voltages. Follow a guide devoted\nto your specific model, to maximize safety and success rates.\nTry other repairs. There are many ways an LCD monitor can go wrong,\nbut the diagnostics above cover the most common problems. Try the\nsuggested fix that matches your problem first. If your problem is not described[1]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 2/9above, or if the monitor still won\'t work after the attempted fix, consider these\nissues as well:\nIf the picture responds to input but displays a messy image, such as\njumbled multicolored squares, the AV (audio visual) board may be\ndamaged. This is usually a rectangular circuit board located near the audio\nand visual cables. Replace obviously damaged parts using a soldering iron,\nor order a replacement board and carefully install it to the same screws and\nribbon cables.\nThe main control buttons may be faulty. Clean them with a metal cleaner,\nor jostle to attach a loose connection. If necessary, locate the circuit board\nthey are attached to and re-solder any broken connections.\nCheck input cables for damage, or try other cables of the same type. If\nnecessary, inspect the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder\ndamaged connections.\nAdvertisement\n1\n2Replacing Bad Capacitors\nUnderstand the danger. The capacitors may hold a major charge even\nafter you disconnect the power. If you handle them improperly, you can\nreceive a dangerous or even lethal electric shock. Take the following steps to\nprotect yourself and your monitor\'s components:\nBe honest about your abilities. If you have never replaced a circuit board or\nhandled electronic equipment before, hire a professional. This is not a good\nrepair for beginners.\nWear static-free clothing and work in a static-free environment. Keep the\narea clear of wool, metal, paper, lint, dust, children, and pets.\nAvoid working in dry or wet conditions. A humidity level between 35 and\n50% is ideal.\nGround yourself before you begin. You can do this by touching the metal\nchassis of the monitor, while the monitor is off but plugged into a grounded\noutlet.\nStand on a low-friction surface. Before working on carpet, treat it with an\nanti-static spray.\nWear tight rubber gloves if you are still able to manipulate the components\ninvolved.\nDisconnect the power. Unplug the monitor. If the monitor is attached to a\nlaptop or other battery-powered device, remove the battery. These steps\nwill reduce the chance of an electric shock.Method\n2\n[2]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 3/93\n4\n5\n6\n7Even if your laptop has a "non-removable" battery, you can usually remove\nit after opening up the device. Follow an online guide for your laptop model.\nSome components inside the laptop will continue to hold charge. Use\ncaution and do not touch any component until you have identified it.\nKeep careful track of your progress. Work on a large, flat surface\ncleared of all other objects. Use small containers to hold each screw and\nother removable components. Label each container with the name of the\ncomponent the screw held down, or with the step number from this guide.\nConsider photographing the monitor before you separate any connections.\nThis will help you fit the monitor back together again.\nRemove the case. Unscrew the plastic case at each corner, or wherever\nyou see screws holding the back and front frames together. Pry it apart\nusing a thin, flexible tool. A plastic putty knife works well.\nPrying apart components with a metal object risks destroying them with\nchipping or an electrical short. A metal object is relatively safe for this initial\nstep, but do not use it for any further steps.\nLocate the power supply board. This circuit board usually sits near the\npower socket. You may need to unscrew additional panels to find it. This\ncircuit board is the one with several cylindrical capacitors, including one large\none. However, these capacitors are usually located on the other side, and are\nnot visible until you finish disconnecting the board.\nIf you are not sure which board is the power supply, search online for an\nimage of your specific model.\nDo not touch any of the metal pins on this board. They may deliver an\nelectric shock.\nDisconnect the circuit board. Remove all screws and ribbon cables\nholding the circuit board in place. Always disconnect a cable by pulling\ndirectly out of the socket. If you pull a ribbon cable vertically when it is in a\nhorizontal socket, you can easily break it.\nSome ribbon cables have a small tab you can pull to disconnect them.\nLocate and discharge the largest capacitors. Carefully lift the board by\nthe edges, without touching any metal pins or attached components. On\nthe other side of the board, locate the cylindrical capacitors. Each one is\nattached to the board with two pins. Discharge the stored electricity to reduce\nthe risk of harm, as follows:[3]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 4/98\n9\n10\n11Purchase a resistor in the range of 1.8–2.2k\u03a9 and 5–10 watts. This is much\nsafer than using a screwdriver, which may create sparks or destroy the\nboard.\nPut on rubber gloves.\nLocate the pins attached to the largest capacitor. Touch the two resistor\nleads to the pins for several seconds.\nFor best results, test the voltage between the pins with a multimeter. Use\nresistor again if significant voltage remains.\nRepeat with each of the largest capacitors. The smaller cylinders cannot\ntypically cause serious harm.\nIdentify and photograph broken capacitors. Look for a capacitor with a\ndomed or bulging top, instead of a flat one. Check each capacitor for\nleaking fluid, or a crusty buildup of dried fluid. Before removal, photograph or\nrecord the position of each capacitor and the markings on its side. It\'s very\nimportant that you know which pin attaches to the negative side of the\ncapacitor, and which to the positive. If you are removing more than one type of\ncapacitor, make sure you know where each one goes.\nIf none of the capacitors look damaged, test each one with a multimeter set\nto resistance.\nSome capacitors are shaped like small discs instead of cylinders. These\nrarely break, but check to make sure none are bulging outward.\nDesolder broken capacitors. As described in the linked article, use a\nsoldering iron and desoldering pump to remove the pins connecting faulty\ncapacitors. Set aside the broken capacitors.\nPurchase replacements. Any electronics supply store should sell\ncapacitors at very low prices. Look for a capacitor with the following\nattributes:\nSize — identical to the old capacitor\nVoltage (V, WV, or WVDC) — equal to the old capacitor, or slightly higher\nCapacitance (F or µF) — equal to the old capacitor\nSolder the new capacitors. Use your soldering iron to attach the new\ncapacitors to the circuit board. Make sure to connect the negative\n(striped) side of each capacitor to the same pin that was attached to the\nnegative side of the old capacitor. Check that all new connections are solidly\nconnected.\nUse soldering wire suitable for electronics.\nIf you\'ve lost track of where the capacitors were located, look online for a\ndiagram of your model\'s power supply board.6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 5/912Fit back together and test. Reattach all cables, panels, and\ncomponents exactly as they were before. You may test the monitor\nbefore screwing in the final plastic panel, as long as all other parts are\nconnected. If it still doesn\'t work, you may need to hire a professional or buy a\nreplacement.\nAdvertisement\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6Replacing the Backlight\nDisconnect the power source. Unplug the monitor or remove the battery\nfrom the laptop.\nOpen up the monitor. Unscrew the plastic case at each corner. Carefully\npry apart the case with a plastic putty knife.Detach all components\nattached to the display panel, noting where each one goes.\nLocate the backlight. These glass lights should be just behind the glass\ndisplay. You may need to unscrew additional panels or gently pull back\nflexible covers in order to find them.\nSome components can deliver a dangerous electric shock. Do not touch\nany circuit boards during your search, unless you are wearing rubber\ngloves.\nPurchase exact replacements at an electronics store. If you\'re not sure\nwhat types of light they are, take a photograph and show it to the store\nemployee. Measure the size of the lights as well, or note the size and model of\nyour monitor.\nRemove old lights and insert new ones. Use caution if the backlight is a\ncold cathode fluorescent light (CCFL). These contain mercury and may\nrequire special disposal according to local laws.\nTry additional repairs. If the monitor still won\'t light up, the problem may\nbe with the circuit board powering the backlight. This is called an "inverter"\nboard, and is usually located near the backlight, with one "cap" for each strip of\nlights.Order a replacement and carefully replace this component. For best\nresults and minimum risk, follow a guide dedicated to your specific model.\nBefore you try this, confirm that the monitor still produces a visible image\nwhen you shine a light on the screen. If it has stopped displaying an imageMethod\n3\n[4] \n[5]\n[6]\n[7] 6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 6/9entirely, you may have not connected it correctly after the light\nreplacement.

What should I do?\nQuestion\nWhat do I do if my monitor says "power saving mode"?\nAdvertisementCommunity Answer\nTry plugging it into another computer and see if it still has those lines. If it\ndoes, then it\'s your monitor\'s problem. If there is no issue with another\ncomputer, try reinstalling the drivers from nvidia.\nSomone\nCommunity Answer\nThat sound like flickering. Follow the instructions above.\nSomone\nCommunity Answer\nThat is an automatic thing. If the computer is inactive for awhile, the monitor\nwill go to a "standby" state. However, the computer tower itself will not unless\nthe settings are configured to do so.6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 7/9Tips\nCheck local laws before throwing away or recycling old components.\nReplacing an LCD display panel can significantly change the colors of the\ndisplay. Recalibrate your monitor to fix this. Replace the backlight if calibration\ndoesn\'t do the trick.\nIf none of these steps work on graphical issues your monitor may be having\ncheck your computer\'s graphics card. It may be the problem.\nAdvertisement\nWarnings\nIf any cables tear during the repair, the LCD monitor will not work. You can try\ntaking it to a professional repair service, but this is most likely the end of its life.\nA blown fuse usually destroyed itself due to an underlying problem, and the\nreplacement may do the same. If you find one, consider replacing the entire\ncircuit board, or buying a new monitor. Never use a fuse with a higher\namperage, as this can destroy other components or start a fire.\nAdvertisement\nThings You May Need\nScrewdriver\nSoft cloth\nFlashlight\nStuck pixel repair software\nPutty knife\nReplacement components\nSoldering iron\nSolder suitable for electronics\nDesoldering pump\nResistor6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 8/9Advertisement\nExpert Interview\nThanks for reading our article!

If you can seeMethod\n16/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 1/94\n5\n6\n7the image when you point a light at the screen, the monitor\'s backlight is at\nfault. Follow these instructions to replace it.\nRepair stuck pixels. If most of the screen works but a few pixels are\n"stuck" at one color, the fix is usually easy. Keep the monitor on and try the\nfollowing:\nWrap a pencil tip (or other blunt, narrow object) in a damp, non-abrasive\ncloth. Rub very gently over the stuck pixel. Rubbing too hard can cause\nfurther damage.\nSearch for stuck pixel repair software online. These conduct rapid color\nchanges to jolt the pixel into working again.\nPurchase hardware designed to plug into your monitor and repair dead\npixels.\nIf none of the above works, you may need to replace your screen.\nAttempt to fix spiderweb cracks or black splotches. These are signs of\nphysical damage. A monitor at this stage is often beyond repair, and\nattempts to fix it can end up causing more harm. However, if the screen is not\nusable in its current state, there\'s no harm in trying a repair before you look for\na replacement:\nRun a soft cloth or other object over the screen. If you feel any broken\nglass, do not attempt repair. Replace the monitor instead.\nRub the scratch with a clean eraser, as gently as you can. Wipe off the\neraser whenever residue builds up.\nPurchase an LCD scratch repair kit.\nRead this article for more homemade solutions.\nReplace the display. If you\'re using a standalone LCD monitor, consider\npurchasing a replacement. This may be more cost-effective than having\nnew components installed in an old monitor with a shorter lifespan. However, if\nyou have a laptop or a relatively new device, purchase a replacement LCD\ndisplay panel. Hire a professional to install it.\nThe panel serial number should be displayed somewhere on the device,\nusually on the back. Use this to order a new panel from the manufacturer.\nWhile you can attempt to replace the panel yourself, the process is difficult\nand can expose you to dangerously high voltages. Follow a guide devoted\nto your specific model, to maximize safety and success rates.\nTry other repairs. There are many ways an LCD monitor can go wrong,\nbut the diagnostics above cover the most common problems. Try the\nsuggested fix that matches your problem first. If your problem is not described[1]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 2/9above, or if the monitor still won\'t work after the attempted fix, consider these\nissues as well:\nIf the picture responds to input but displays a messy image, such as\njumbled multicolored squares, the AV (audio visual) board may be\ndamaged. This is usually a rectangular circuit board located near the audio\nand visual cables. Replace obviously damaged parts using a soldering iron,\nor order a replacement board and carefully install it to the same screws and\nribbon cables.\nThe main control buttons may be faulty. Clean them with a metal cleaner,\nor jostle to attach a loose connection. If necessary, locate the circuit board\nthey are attached to and re-solder any broken connections.\nCheck input cables for damage, or try other cables of the same type. If\nnecessary, inspect the circuit board they are attached to and re-solder\ndamaged connections.\nAdvertisement\n1\n2Replacing Bad Capacitors\nUnderstand the danger. The capacitors may hold a major charge even\nafter you disconnect the power. If you handle them improperly, you can\nreceive a dangerous or even lethal electric shock. Take the following steps to\nprotect yourself and your monitor\'s components:\nBe honest about your abilities. If you have never replaced a circuit board or\nhandled electronic equipment before, hire a professional. This is not a good\nrepair for beginners.\nWear static-free clothing and work in a static-free environment. Keep the\narea clear of wool, metal, paper, lint, dust, children, and pets.\nAvoid working in dry or wet conditions. A humidity level between 35 and\n50% is ideal.\nGround yourself before you begin. You can do this by touching the metal\nchassis of the monitor, while the monitor is off but plugged into a grounded\noutlet.\nStand on a low-friction surface. Before working on carpet, treat it with an\nanti-static spray.\nWear tight rubber gloves if you are still able to manipulate the components\ninvolved.\nDisconnect the power. Unplug the monitor. If the monitor is attached to a\nlaptop or other battery-powered device, remove the battery. These steps\nwill reduce the chance of an electric shock.Method\n2\n[2]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 3/93\n4\n5\n6\n7Even if your laptop has a "non-removable" battery, you can usually remove\nit after opening up the device. Follow an online guide for your laptop model.\nSome components inside the laptop will continue to hold charge. Use\ncaution and do not touch any component until you have identified it.\nKeep careful track of your progress. Work on a large, flat surface\ncleared of all other objects. Use small containers to hold each screw and\nother removable components. Label each container with the name of the\ncomponent the screw held down, or with the step number from this guide.\nConsider photographing the monitor before you separate any connections.\nThis will help you fit the monitor back together again.\nRemove the case. Unscrew the plastic case at each corner, or wherever\nyou see screws holding the back and front frames together. Pry it apart\nusing a thin, flexible tool. A plastic putty knife works well.\nPrying apart components with a metal object risks destroying them with\nchipping or an electrical short. A metal object is relatively safe for this initial\nstep, but do not use it for any further steps.\nLocate the power supply board. This circuit board usually sits near the\npower socket. You may need to unscrew additional panels to find it. This\ncircuit board is the one with several cylindrical capacitors, including one large\none. However, these capacitors are usually located on the other side, and are\nnot visible until you finish disconnecting the board.\nIf you are not sure which board is the power supply, search online for an\nimage of your specific model.\nDo not touch any of the metal pins on this board. They may deliver an\nelectric shock.\nDisconnect the circuit board. Remove all screws and ribbon cables\nholding the circuit board in place. Always disconnect a cable by pulling\ndirectly out of the socket. If you pull a ribbon cable vertically when it is in a\nhorizontal socket, you can easily break it.\nSome ribbon cables have a small tab you can pull to disconnect them.\nLocate and discharge the largest capacitors. Carefully lift the board by\nthe edges, without touching any metal pins or attached components. On\nthe other side of the board, locate the cylindrical capacitors. Each one is\nattached to the board with two pins. Discharge the stored electricity to reduce\nthe risk of harm, as follows:[3]6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 4/98\n9\n10\n11Purchase a resistor in the range of 1.8–2.2k\u03a9 and 5–10 watts. This is much\nsafer than using a screwdriver, which may create sparks or destroy the\nboard.\nPut on rubber gloves.\nLocate the pins attached to the largest capacitor. Touch the two resistor\nleads to the pins for several seconds.\nFor best results, test the voltage between the pins with a multimeter. Use\nresistor again if significant voltage remains.\nRepeat with each of the largest capacitors. The smaller cylinders cannot\ntypically cause serious harm.\nIdentify and photograph broken capacitors. Look for a capacitor with a\ndomed or bulging top, instead of a flat one. Check each capacitor for\nleaking fluid, or a crusty buildup of dried fluid. Before removal, photograph or\nrecord the position of each capacitor and the markings on its side. It\'s very\nimportant that you know which pin attaches to the negative side of the\ncapacitor, and which to the positive. If you are removing more than one type of\ncapacitor, make sure you know where each one goes.\nIf none of the capacitors look damaged, test each one with a multimeter set\nto resistance.\nSome capacitors are shaped like small discs instead of cylinders. These\nrarely break, but check to make sure none are bulging outward.\nDesolder broken capacitors. As described in the linked article, use a\nsoldering iron and desoldering pump to remove the pins connecting faulty\ncapacitors. Set aside the broken capacitors.\nPurchase replacements. Any electronics supply store should sell\ncapacitors at very low prices. Look for a capacitor with the following\nattributes:\nSize — identical to the old capacitor\nVoltage (V, WV, or WVDC) — equal to the old capacitor, or slightly higher\nCapacitance (F or µF) — equal to the old capacitor\nSolder the new capacitors. Use your soldering iron to attach the new\ncapacitors to the circuit board. Make sure to connect the negative\n(striped) side of each capacitor to the same pin that was attached to the\nnegative side of the old capacitor. Check that all new connections are solidly\nconnected.\nUse soldering wire suitable for electronics.\nIf you\'ve lost track of where the capacitors were located, look online for a\ndiagram of your model\'s power supply board.6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 5/912Fit back together and test. Reattach all cables, panels, and\ncomponents exactly as they were before. You may test the monitor\nbefore screwing in the final plastic panel, as long as all other parts are\nconnected. If it still doesn\'t work, you may need to hire a professional or buy a\nreplacement.\nAdvertisement\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6Replacing the Backlight\nDisconnect the power source. Unplug the monitor or remove the battery\nfrom the laptop.\nOpen up the monitor. Unscrew the plastic case at each corner. Carefully\npry apart the case with a plastic putty knife.Detach all components\nattached to the display panel, noting where each one goes.\nLocate the backlight. These glass lights should be just behind the glass\ndisplay. You may need to unscrew additional panels or gently pull back\nflexible covers in order to find them.\nSome components can deliver a dangerous electric shock. Do not touch\nany circuit boards during your search, unless you are wearing rubber\ngloves.\nPurchase exact replacements at an electronics store. If you\'re not sure\nwhat types of light they are, take a photograph and show it to the store\nemployee. Measure the size of the lights as well, or note the size and model of\nyour monitor.\nRemove old lights and insert new ones. Use caution if the backlight is a\ncold cathode fluorescent light (CCFL). These contain mercury and may\nrequire special disposal according to local laws.\nTry additional repairs. If the monitor still won\'t light up, the problem may\nbe with the circuit board powering the backlight. This is called an "inverter"\nboard, and is usually located near the backlight, with one "cap" for each strip of\nlights.Order a replacement and carefully replace this component. For best\nresults and minimum risk, follow a guide dedicated to your specific model.\nBefore you try this, confirm that the monitor still produces a visible image\nwhen you shine a light on the screen.

Recalibrate your monitor to fix this. Replace the backlight if calibration\ndoesn\'t do the trick.\nIf none of these steps work on graphical issues your monitor may be having\ncheck your computer\'s graphics card. It may be the problem.\nAdvertisement\nWarnings\nIf any cables tear during the repair, the LCD monitor will not work. You can try\ntaking it to a professional repair service, but this is most likely the end of its life.\nA blown fuse usually destroyed itself due to an underlying problem, and the\nreplacement may do the same. If you find one, consider replacing the entire\ncircuit board, or buying a new monitor. Never use a fuse with a higher\namperage, as this can destroy other components or start a fire.\nAdvertisement\nThings You May Need\nScrewdriver\nSoft cloth\nFlashlight\nStuck pixel repair software\nPutty knife\nReplacement components\nSoldering iron\nSolder suitable for electronics\nDesoldering pump\nResistor6/20/24, 8:16 AM 3 Ways to Repair LCD Monitors - wikiHow\nhttps://www.wikihow.com/Repair-LCD-Monitors#:~:text=Shine a flashlight on the,these instructions to replace it. 8/9Advertisement\nExpert Interview\nThanks for reading our article!
